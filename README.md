# TriviaGame
Tivia Game using Javascript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML.

<h2>How does it Work?</h2>
After pressing the start button, only one question will be displayed with a timer aside until the player answers it or their time runs out. The player must choose an option to answer the question.

When the player's time runs out or the player has already chosen an answer, the timer disappears and the correct answer is shown with a brief explanation about it.

After 6 seconds, the next question will be shown and the timer is being displayed again.

When the player completes the 10 questions trivia, a screen will show the number of right answers, wrong answers, and unanswered questions. A replay button will also be shown to restart the game if the player wants to.
